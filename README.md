# text_to_NetCDF
Interpolation of unstructured xyz data (e.g. bathymetry) in .txt or .csv format to a structured grid. in .nc format  

Boundary generation scripts including to create a mask for clipping resultant gridded data.  

Written for a very large data set of 100m+ points where the resolution was being reduced and hence nearest neighbour interpolation used.
